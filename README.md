# 👨‍💻 Full Stack Engineer with Front End Focus


I enjoy building websites and apps with React & React Native, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue.js. I aspire to create great user experiences through simple, easy to navigate user interfaces. I use tools like Figma and Illustrator to design and build pages and use Node, Python and full-stack JavaScript to connect user interfaces to backend systems. I am also passionate about sustainable energy, self-driving/electric vehicles and IoT home automation.
